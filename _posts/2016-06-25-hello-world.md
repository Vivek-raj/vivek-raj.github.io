  So i have decided to write myself a website as a place for me to write some form of blog with articles/tutorials about certain types of development things.<br/><br/>
  This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I have customzied the default theme a bit. <br/><br/>
  I am not quite sure where i am going with this, but i like creating projects based on the concepts i like and will be writing articles based on my learning experiences.<br/><br/>
  Currently i am working on frameworks like nodejs, expressjs, emberjs, mongodb, firebase etc. Hopefully i will be posting the projects i build as tutorials. If you got any doubts of any kind regarding my project or you want some kind of help with your projects, do not hesitate to contact me.<br/><br/>
